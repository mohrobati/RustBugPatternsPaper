\subsection{Mining Bug Fix Patters}


Yang et al. proposed a mining approach to detect Python bug fix patterns via studying
fine-grained fixing code changes. In their research, they also examined what portion of the bugs
could be fixed using automated bug fixing approaches. Moreover, they evaluated the fix patterns in
the wild and realized that 37\% of the buggy codes could be matched by the fix patterns they had
found. \\
Hanam et al. conducted a similar research but for finding Javascript most pervasive bug fix
patterns. They presented a large-scale study of the most common bug fix patterns by mining 105K
commits from 134 server-side JavaScript projects. They used DBSCAN clustering algorithm
and divided bug fixing change types into 219 clusters, from which they extracted 13 pervasive
cross-project bug fix patterns. \\
