Dear Prof. Feldt,

Thank you for the opportunity to resubmit a revision of our paper ``A
Study of Common Bug Fix Patterns in Rust'' to EMSE. We also thank the
reviewers for their thoughtful reviews. We are submitting a revised
paper (and diffs), along with our responses to the reviews. We briefly
summarize our responses here.

* Discussion: We wholeheartedly agree that it is important to show
  that the patterns that we identified are valuable. We have added an
  all-new Section 4.1, “Patterns Present and Missing” (specifically
  discussing the value of the top 10 patterns and summarizing our
  learnings) and mostly-new content in Section 4.2 “Usefulness of Rust
  Bug Patterns” (discussing the general usefulness of patterns), as
  well as paragraphs on actionability to 6 of the groups of patterns.

* Methodology & Experiments: We appreciate reviewer comments on this
  topic and have sought to engage with these comments. We believe that
  the choices we made initially were appropriate and either comparable
  or better than past related work; and that the experiments that the
  reviewers suggested would be infeasible (due to computational
  complexity or dataset availability), or not provide additional
  insight into the problem.

* Clarity: We have incorporated almost all of the reviewer
  suggestions, and believe that they have improved the paper. Thanks!

We look forward to the reviewers' opinions on this revision of our paper.

Thank you,

Mohammad Robati Shirzad & Patrick Lam
